# Task-4
The Excel file Excel Project Dataset.xlsx contains structured data related to world population statistics. The dataset is organized into rows and columns, with each row representing a country or territory and each column capturing a different demographic or statistical measure.

Key Features of the Dataset
Country/Territory Name: The name of each country or region included in the dataset.

Rank: A ranking based on a population-related metric (e.g., total population size).

Population Data: Likely includes current population estimates and possibly historical comparisons.

Additional Metrics: May include indicators such as:

Population density

Land area

Growth rate

Percentage of world population

These columns provide a comprehensive overview of global population distribution and comparative rankings.

This dataset can be used for:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understanding trends, distributions, and outliers in population statistics.

Visualization Projects: Creating graphs, charts, and maps to represent demographic data.

Ranking and Comparison: Analyzing how countries compare in terms of population and growth.

Educational Insights: Learning how to interpret demographic datasets and build insights for academic or professional use.
